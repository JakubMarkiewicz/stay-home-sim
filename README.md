# stay-home-sim

Advanced social distancing simulatior. Fight COVID-19, squash the curve. At home.

### Inspiration:

- [this article](https://www.washingtonpost.com/graphics/2020/world/corona-simulator/)

### Stack:

- [React](https://reactjs.org/)
- [Ant Design](https://ant.design/)
- [p5](https://p5js.org/) <3 (movement smulation created on top of [this example](https://p5js.org/examples/motion-bouncy-bubbles.html))

### Things to do/to consider:

- mobile mode!
- manual control over simulation parameters (population, social distancing rate, speed rate e.t.c)
- optimizations - use home cooked canvas manipulations instead of f5; implement spatial hash optimization
